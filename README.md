# Sudoku Solver

> Just a toy. Suddenly want one, so write one. No further story.

## Usage

```
  Given a language and a sample, diff the actual and expected.

  Usage
  $ ./try <language> [sample-index=0]

  Examples
  $ ./try python
  $ ./try python 0
```

In fact I've only got one language (Python) and one sample (with index 0), cause I got bored after finishing them.

## Contribution

Better algorithms or implementations in any language are welcome.
